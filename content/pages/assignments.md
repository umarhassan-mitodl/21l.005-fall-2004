This course requires submission of analytic response papers (2-3 pages each) on four of the plays read or attended; a theatrical scene, with dialogue (3-5 pages); and a major paper ({{% resource_link 895dfbf7-c25d-f9e0-4c4a-80b4eaac1a29 "PDF" %}}). There is also a final exam. In addition, during the latter half of the course, students are required to lead the discussion of one play, and to perform in a scene from it as part of that process. They must also give a brief (5-minute) presentation based on the research paper, sharing their most interesting insights with the class.

Introductory Discussion.

_Objective_

To think hard about "drama": meanings, assumptions, prejudices. To understand why this class matters and how it is designed, and recognizing the skills to be learned.

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Read _The Bacchae_.

"Read" means:   
Read through the entire play quickly, as if you were an audience member watching it take place before you (i.e., read sequentially and don't worry about every detail or go back over a scene studiously-though try to attend to as many clues and dimensions of the script as you can). Consider the play's sequence and impact.

Re-read slowly and analytically, looking for meanings, patterns, poetry, characterization and themes, and studying the sections that confused you. Consider the play's artistry and ideas.

Reflect upon some particular aspect or angle, a character or scene or dimension of thought, language, or staging, that particularly interests you. Consider why it does.
